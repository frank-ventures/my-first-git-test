# my-first-git-test

Here we are, using Git.

How fantastical.
How amazing.
One might say, it's absolutely wild!

First, we cloned down the repository from Git to my local machine.

Then, I created an index.html file.
Nothing special, it was just boilerplate really.

After, style.css was created to make it look super jazzy and ultra-modern. There's even some 'hover' effects thrown in for true MySpace measure.

Enjoy.
